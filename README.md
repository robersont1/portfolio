**About**
My name is Tanner Roberson. I am in the first year of my Master's degree in computer engineering at the University of North Texas. I graduated summa cum laude with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of North Texas in 2024.
Over the course of my college education, I have developed a strong interest in chip design and computer architecture. As such, I am seeking an internship for the summer of 2026 in computer architecture or digital integrated circuit design.
